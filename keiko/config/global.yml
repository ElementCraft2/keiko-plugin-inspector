#### Keiko: Global Configuration ##################################################
#
#   Welcome here!
#
#   This file lets you configure, as its name supposes, global options, that
# affect Keiko in general (all its parts at the same time).
#
#   Useful stuff:
#
#     1. Keiko Wiki (a lot of useful information):
#        --> https://github.com/MeGysssTaa/keiko-plugin-inspector/wiki
#
#     2. Keiko Discord (for questions, discussion, and live support):
#        --> https://discord.gg/QWHzCXX

# What locale (language) should Keiko display its messages in? ('en_US', and so on...)
# https://github.com/MeGysssTaa/keiko-plugin-inspector/wiki/Locales
# 'system' means that Keiko will attempt to use the current system (OS) locale.
locale: system

# Keiko updater options.
updater:

  # Updates check interval, in minutes. If set to 0, Keiko will only check for updates
  # at startup, and will not run any periodic checks. If set to -1, Keiko will not check
  # for updates at all (not recommended!).
  interval_minutes: 120

  # Should Keiko download and install updates automatially when it finds them?
  # You will still have to restart your server manually for the changes to apply!
  download: true

# Keiko automatically deletes log files that are older than the number of days
# specified below. If you don't want Keiko to manage its logs automatically,
# you can disable this feature by setting logs_lifespan_days to -1.
logs_lifespan_days: 14

# Minimum level (severity) of messages that Keiko should log.
# Available level names (ordered by severity, ascending):
# --  debug  info  warning  error  user_input_request  off
#                                                      ^^^ Disables logging completely.
log_level:
  console: info
  file: debug


# Should Keiko abort startup if it fails to analyze at least one of the plugins?
# Enabling this is strongly (!) recommended. If you disable this, malicious plugins
# with some tricky obfuscation/encryption may run and harm your server.
abort_on_error: true
