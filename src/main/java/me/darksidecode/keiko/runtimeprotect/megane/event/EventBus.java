    /**
     * Dispatch all events in a separate thread. The rationale behind this is:
     *
     *     1. We want our checks to run in background, without interrupting or pausing any
     *        actions. We don't want the server to lag if one of our heuristics lags.
     *
     *     2. This allows us to react to events seamlessly from another thread. For example,
     *        we cannot de-op a player right inside the OpUpdate event listener because that
     *        task involves writing to a file, and since the event is called before the initial
     *        (original) write to the ops file, our de-opping file write will be overwritten, or,
     *        in other words, will not work. But from another thread, we can easily do so.
     *
     * We don't really want multiple threads to be used for event dispatch, though, or at least
     * that's my thoughts at the moment. Events are better synchronized and ordered as they were.
